# Project Name: HarambeeHub

## Harambee-Blockchain-Funding
A decentralized platform that facilitates community-based fundraising (Harambe) for medical, educational, and business needs. Using blockchain, it ensures transparency and accountability for all contributions.

### Problem Statement:
The traditional Harambe system in Kenya, where community members contribute to help one another, faces issues of accountability and transparency. There is no centralized platform for tracking contributions, and fund misuse is a common concern.

### Approach:
Develop a decentralized platform on Aptos where community contributions (Harambe) can be transparently managed. Each contributor's payment is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring full accountability. Smart contracts will manage the allocation of funds, and contributors can track how their money is being used.

### Vision:
To enhance trust and efficiency in community fundraising, allowing members to contribute confidently and transparently. The platform will foster stronger communities and reduce fraud.

### Technologies/Tools:

- Aptos Blockchain: For secure and transparent recording of contributions.
- Move Smart Contracts: To automate fund disbursements and ensure they follow agreed-upon terms.
- UI: A simple dashboard for tracking contributions and fund use.

### Scalability:
After piloting in Kenya, this system can be adopted in other countries where similar community-based financial practices exist, addressing similar issues of accountability.
